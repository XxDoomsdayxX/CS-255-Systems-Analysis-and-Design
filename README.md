# CS-255-Systems-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company providing driver training. Liam wanted a system that would allow customers to register, schedule driving lessons, and access online learning resources, including practice tests. The system also needed to allow admins and IT staff to manage users, reset passwords, and keep course material up to date with DMV policies.

What did you do particularly well?

One aspect I did particularly well was accurately identifying the system’s key use cases and actors. I created UML diagrams that captured the core functionalities required for each type of user, from scheduling lessons to managing system accounts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the user interface design details. I would improve it by including more visual mockups or wireframes to ensure that the design is user-friendly and intuitive. This would help communicate the flow of information more clearly for both developers and stakeholders.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by thoroughly reviewing the interview transcript and business requirements to understand the interactions each actor would have with the system. By mapping out these requirements in the UML diagrams, I ensured that the system design met all essential functionality. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the system is intuitive, meets user expectations, and effectively solves the client’s problems.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I approach it by first breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces, such as identifying use cases and user interactions. I would use UML diagrams to visualize the system's structure and flow, and incorporate feedback loops to iterate on the design based on user or stakeholder feedback. In the future, I plan to focus more on user experience (UX) design techniques to better tailor systems to user workflows, ensuring that every design decision is backed by how it will benefit the user.
